# Unexpected Rendering Behavior in Next.js 15 App

This repository demonstrates an uncommon rendering issue encountered in a Next.js 15 application when utilizing the `React.useEffect` and `React.useState` hooks.  The counter in a child component fails to update consistently after a button click, resulting in an incorrect display of the count.

## Bug Description

A simple counter is implemented using `useState` to manage the count.  The `useEffect` hook is used to log the updated count.  However, despite the button click triggering the state update, the displayed count and the console logs often show inconsistencies or delays. The component re-renders, but the `count` variable is not always updated immediately. 

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Observe the counter on the webpage.
5. Click the increment button multiple times and note the inconsistencies in count display and console logs.

## Solution
The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.  The primary reason for the issue is the improper usage of `useEffect`'s dependency array. Adding `count` as a dependency ensures the effect runs whenever the count changes, ensuring consistent updates. The solution fixes the issue by correctly specifying dependencies and resolving unnecessary re-renders.
